#  Code Refactor Homework

For this homework assignment I demonstrated my knowledge of HTML and CSS modifying a webpages code to make it more semantically correct without disrupting the functionality and overall structure.

For the HTML, I used best practices to change div elements to semantic elements to make it more clear to developers viewing my code later. I also made the code more accessible by including alt attributes to images and aria-labels as needed. I also found a broken link and repaired it so the the user would been taken to the section of the page corresponding to the link.

For the CSS, I consolidated the code so that similar sections shared the same properties without having to duplicate the code. I have commented the stylesheet where I have made these changes. Any changes I made to the HTML elements and classes were also corrected in the stylesheet.
